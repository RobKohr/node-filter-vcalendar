# node-filter-vcalendar

Creates an express node.js webserver that when you hit the root path, it will fetch a vcal url that is set in the config, and then filter out all events that match specified keywords.

This was created for my son's school calendar that was full of too many repeating events that were not important, and were crowding out events that were important.
